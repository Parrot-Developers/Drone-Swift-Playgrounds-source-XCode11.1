 **Challenge:** Draw a square in the air. Again.

 For the second challenge, you will make the drone follow a square path in the air, but this time on the horizontal plane. You will create a [function](glossary://function) called `horizontalSquare()`, using only [pitch](glossary://pitch) and [yaw](glossary://yaw) commands. Also, you will be using a `for` [loop](glossary://loop) to simplify the code.
