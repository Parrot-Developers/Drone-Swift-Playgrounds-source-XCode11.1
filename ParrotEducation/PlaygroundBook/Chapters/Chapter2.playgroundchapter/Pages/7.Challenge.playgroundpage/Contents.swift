 **Challenge:** Create your own flight plan.
 
 Now itâ€™s time to put it all together and navigate your drone just like a pilot.
 First select a destination. Then create two different flight plans to get there.
 
 The first one should be the fatest and most direct way to get from point A to point B where your drone can fly at top speed most of the way.
 
 The second should be a path where your drone would be the least detected, so it may need to adjust speed or do extra flips to avoid detection.
 
 Between your two flight plans, make sure you:
 1) Include at least 3 different simple moves and 1 complex move.
 2) Experiment with different speeds.
 3) Be sure to include functions and loops in your code.
